OCPromptView-IOS7-Compatible
============================

OCPromptView  Worked only till iOS 6 (orgianlly by Objective Coders) 
- iOS7 onwards we can not add subviews to many classed such as UIAlertView etc. So I made changes so that we can still use this class with backward compatiblity right uptill iOS4. Check it out.
